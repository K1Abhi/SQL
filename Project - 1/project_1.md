# Project: Credit Card Transaction Analysis

The goal of this project is to analyze credit card transaction data to uncover key insights such as top spending cities, card-type trends, spending behavior across different timeframes, and gender-based contributions. By leveraging SQL queries, we will derive actionable insights that can help financial institutions understand customer spending patterns.

## Dataset Overview:
The project uses a dataset named CREDIT_CARD_TRANSCATIONS with the following columns:

```TEXT
INDEX (INTEGER):     Unique identifier for each transaction.
CITY (VARCHAR):      The city where the transaction took place.
DATE (TIMESTAMP):    The date and time of the transaction.
CARD_TYPE (VARCHAR): The type of credit card used (e.g., Gold, Silver, Platinum, etc.).
EXP_TYPE (VARCHAR):  The expense category (e.g., Fuel, Shopping, Dining, etc.).
GENDER (VARCHAR):    The gender of the cardholder.
AMOUNT (INTEGER):    The transaction amount.
```
